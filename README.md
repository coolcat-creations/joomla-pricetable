# Joomla Alternate layout for price table
This menutype for a blog shows items in a pricetable (current Version is BS2 and works with Protostar) 
You need a category and inside this category subcategories.
This Layout uses a custom field named price and a repeatable custom field names features with the fields icon-class and feature in it.

I am doing that for fun and to support the community. However, if you feel like I should have more time for fun things you can support me by "donating" something. I will send you an invoice if needed. https://www.paypal.me/coolcatcreations/
