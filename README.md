# Joomla Alternate layout for price table
This menutype for a blog shows items in a pricetable (current Version is BS2 and works with Protostar) 
You need a category and inside this category subcategories.
This Layout uses:
- Menu title and / or the category title
- the category description as an intro above the table
- The article title as title of the price column
- The article intro text as subline
- a custom field named currency for the currency
- a custom field names price for the price value
- a repeatable custom field named features 
 -- with the fields: icon-class and feature inside
- a custom layout for the readmore button  

I am doing that for fun and to support the community. However, if you feel like I should have more time for fun things you can support me by "donating" something. I will send you an invoice if needed. https://www.paypal.me/coolcatcreations/
